# Abstract

Body fat is an important factor in many medical situations. Measuring body fat can help to assess whether a person is at a health weight. Additionally, obese or overweight can be identified by calculating the body fat. We conducted initial visualization of the body fat dataset with plots and tables, followed by model selection, variable selection, and cross-validation. Model diagnostics was also applied to check whether the model needs any transformation before omitting the outliers. We then select an optimal model that can best predict the body fat.

# Introduction

 A normal body fat is between 25 and 30 percent in women and 18 and 23 percent in men [1]. More than 68% of US adults are considered overweight, and 35% are obese [2]. While the number of people who are overweight or obese are gradually increasing, more people are becoming more concerned about this issue. The goal of this project is to predict the body fat in different patients based on their physical measurements.
 
# Methods

## _Data import and clean_

We imported the original raw dataset-body density data. Among the three target variable: bodyfat_brozek, bodyfat_siri, and density, we have chosen bodyfat_siri as our final target variable. Other two were omitted from the dataset. 

## _Data Exploratory Analysis_

The goal of this part is to have a sense of the distribution of each variables.Correlation was also considered to see whether any variablaes are highly correlated with eachother so that we can try to eliminate the multicollinearity effect. In order to visualize the above information, a descriptive statistics table was made, a boxplot for the target variable, histogram for the predictors, and a correlation plot.

## _Model Selection_

In order to select the most approprate model, we aplied forward, backward, and stepwise selection for comparasion. 

### _Model Diagnostics_
